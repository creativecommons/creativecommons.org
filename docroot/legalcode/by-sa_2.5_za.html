  <br />
  THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENCE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT, PERFOMERS PROTECTION AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR LAW IS PROHIBITED. <br />
  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>&quot;Collective Work&quot;</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this Licence.</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;Derivative Work&quot;</strong> means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works; including an adaptation of a Work, translation, musical Work, dramatization, fictionalization, cinematographic film, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, adaptation for use by sensory disabled persons, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence . Synching is not limited to synchronization of sound and moving images.</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;Entity&quot;</strong> includes a legal person or a number of persons acting together, such as a partnership or an unincorporated association and where appropriate the State or an international organisation.</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;Licensor&quot;</strong> means the individual or Entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;Original Author&quot;</strong> means the individual or Entity who created the Work, and where Performers Protection is applicable the performer.</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;Work&quot;</strong> means the original work of authorship and, where appropriate performance, offered under the terms of this Licence, including literary, musical and artistic works; cinematograph films; sound recordings; broadcasts; programme-carrying signals; published editions and computer programs. The performance must be fixed to constitute a work under this Licence.</li>

  </ol>
<p>      <strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights.</strong> Nothing in this licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair dealing, the general exceptions to protection of copyright works or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner or performer under copyright, performer&rsquo;s protection law or other applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>3. Licence Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence, for the duration of the applicable copyright to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>

  <li>to publish the Work, including as incorporated in Collective Works;</li>

      <li>Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency (SARRAL, NORM) or designated agent, royalties for any record of a musical work You create from the Work (&quot;cover version&quot;) and distribute, subject to a compulsory Licence created under section 14 of the South African Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
    </ol>
<p>      The Licence is irrevocable except for breach as set out in this Licence. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).<br />
      <br />
      <strong>4. Restrictions. </strong>The Licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish or make available. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicence the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and all rights management information. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement or as permitted by law as specified in Section 2. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4 (c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4 (c), as requested.</li>
  <li>You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available a Derivative Work only under the terms of this Licence, a later version of this Licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence, or a Creative Commons iCommons Licence that contains the same Licence Elements as this Licence (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence or other Licence specified in the previous sentence with every copy of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish or make available the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement or as permitted by law as specified in Section 2. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence.</li>
  <li>If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish or make available the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all rights management information for the Work and provide  credit reasonable to the medium or means that You are utilizing:
    <blockquote>
      <p>- (i) the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and or Licensor designates another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in the Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;</p>
      <p>- the title of the Work, if supplied, to the extent reasonably practicable;</p>
      <p>- the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the rights management information or licensing information for the Work;</p>
      <p>- and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  </ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4" type="a">
  <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that violates the moral rights of the author, to be named as author of the Work, and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where such action is or would be prejudicial to the honour or reputation of the author. Provided that an author who authorizes the use of his work in a cinematograph film or a television broadcast or an author of a computer program or a work associated with a computer program may not prevent or object to modifications that are absolutely necessary on technical grounds. Should an author object compliance with a request to remove the authors&rsquo; name from the work in accordance with 4.a above is sufficient to respect the authors&rsquo; moral right.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br />
      </strong><br />
       UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK <em>VOETSTOOTS</em> AND MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE AND IF THE WORK INCLUDES SOFTWARE, WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING CONTRACT, DELICT INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR STATUTORY CLAIMS) FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENCE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br />
      <br />
    <strong>7. Termination</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this Licence.</li>
  <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work. Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different Licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other Licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p>

  <li>If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</li>

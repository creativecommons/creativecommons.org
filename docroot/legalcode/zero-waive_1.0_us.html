        <h3><em>Affirmation and Waiver</em></h3>
<p>
The person who has associated a work with this document (the "Work") affirms that he or she (the "Affirmer") is the/an author or owner of the Work. The Work may be any work of authorship, including a database.
</p>
<p>
The Affirmer hereby fully, permanently and irrevocably waives and relinquishes all of her or his copyright and related or neighboring legal rights in the Work available under any federal or state law, treaty or contract, including but not limited to moral rights, publicity and privacy rights, rights protecting against unfair competition and any rights protecting the extraction, dissemination and reuse of data, whether such rights are present or future, vested or contingent (the "Waiver"). The Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of the Affirmer's heirs or successors.
</p>
<p>
The Affirmer understands and intends that the Waiver has the effect of eliminating and entirely removing from the Affirmer's control all the copyright and related or neighboring legal rights previously held by the Affirmer in the Work, to that extent making the Work freely available to the public for any and all uses and purposes without restriction of any kind, including commercial use and uses in media and formats or by methods that have not yet been invented or conceived. Should the Waiver for any reason be judged legally ineffective in any jurisdiction, the Affirmer hereby grants a free, full, permanent, irrevocable, nonexclusive and worldwide license for all her or his copyright and related or neighboring legal rights in the Work.
</p>
<p>
The Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to the Waiver and has no duty or obligation with respect to the Waiver or use of the Work.

      <p><strong>3. Licence Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms

      and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You,

      in consideration of You exercising the rights, a worldwide,

      royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of

      the Work as stated below:</p>



      <ol type="a">

        <li>to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one

        or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as

        incorporated in the Collective Works;</li>



        <li>to create and reproduce Adaptations of the Work;</li>



        <li>to distribute copies or, display or perform publicly

        <u>including by means of a digital audio transmission</u>,

        the Work, including as incorporated in Collective

        Works;</li>



        <li>to distribute copies of, display, communicate to the

        public or perform publicly, including by means of a digital

        audio transmission the Adaptations of the Work;</li>



        <li style="list-style: none">The above rights may be

        exercised in all media and formats whether now known or

        hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to

        make such modifications as are technically necessary to

        exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights

        not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,

        including but not limited to the rights set forth in

        Section 4, below.</li>

      </ol>



      <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in

      Section 3, above, is expressly made subject to and limited by

      the following restrictions:</p>



      <ol type="a">

        <li>You may reproduce, distribute, publicly display,

        publicly perform, communicate the Work, publicly digitally

        perform the Work or create an adaptation of the Work only

        under the terms of this License and You must include a copy

        of this License, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for

        this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You

        distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly

        digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on

        the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License

        or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted

        hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep

        intact all notices that refer to this License and to the

        disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly

        display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform

        the Work with any technological measures that control

        access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the

        terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the

        Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does

        not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself

        to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You

        create a Collective Work, upon notice from the Licensor,

        You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the

        Collective Work any credit as required by Clause 4(d), as

        requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from

        the Licensor, You must, to the extent practicable, remove

        from the Adaptation any credit as required by Clause 4(d)

        as requested.</li>



        <li>You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,

        or publicly digitally perform an Adaptation only under the

        terms of this License, a later version of this License with

        the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative

        Commons iCommons license that contains the same License

        Elements as this License (e.g.

        Attribution-NonCommercialShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must

        include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,

        this License or other license specified in the previous

        sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Adaptation

        You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or

        publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any

        terms on the Adaptations that alter or restrict the terms

        of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights

        granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices

        that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of

        warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,

        publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the

        Adaptation with any technological measures that control

        access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the

        terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the

        Adaptation as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this

        does not require the Collective Work apart from the

        Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of this

        License.</li>



        <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You

        in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended

        for or directed toward commercial advantage or private

        monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other

        copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or

        otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or

        directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary

        compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary

        compensation in connection with such an exchange of

        copyrighted works.</li>



        <li>If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,

        or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Adaptation or

        Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright

        notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium

        or means You are utilizing, the following:



          <ol type="1">

            <li>the name of the Author (or pseudonym, if

            applicable) if supplied, and/or;</li>



            <li>if the Author and/or Licensor designates another

            party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing

            entity or journal) for attribution in the Licensor's

            copyright notice, terms of service or by other

            reasonable means, the name of such party or

            parties;</li>



            <li>the title of the Work if supplied;</li>



            <li>to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform

            Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to

            be associated with the Work, unless such Uniform

            Resource Identifier does not refer to the copyright

            notice or licensing information for the Work;and</li>



            <li>in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying

            the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "Hindi

            translation of the Work by Author," or "Screenplay

            based on original Work by Author"). Such credit may be

            implemented in any reasonable manner. It is provided,

            however, that in the case of an Adaptation or

            Collective Work, at a minimum, such credit must appear

            where any other comparable authorship credit appears

            and in a manner at least as prominent as such other

            comparable authorship credit.</li>

          </ol>

        </li>

      </ol>



      <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and

      Disclaimer.</strong></p>



      <ol type="a">

        <li>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN

        WRITING, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO

        REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE

        WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,

        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,

        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE

        ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE

        PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.

        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED

        WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</li>



        <li>YOU WARRANT THAT YOU ARE THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OF THE

        CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN YOU SUBMIT THEM TO CREATIVE

        COMMONS.</li>

      </ol>



      <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong></p>



      <p>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO

      EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY

      FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

      EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF

      THE WORK, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>



      <p><strong>7. Termination.</strong></p>



      <ol type="a">

        <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will

        terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms

        of this License. Individuals or entities who have received

        Adaptations or Collective Works from You under this License

        however, will not have their licenses terminated provided

        such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with

        their licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive

        any termination of this License.</li>



        <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license

        granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the

        applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the

        above, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work

        under different license terms or to stop distributing the

        Work at any time; provided, however that any such release

        under different license terms or cessation of distribution

        of the Work will not serve to withdraw this License (or any

        other license that has been, or is required to be, granted

        under the terms of this License), and this License will

        continue in full force and effect unless terminated as

        stated above.</li>

      </ol>



      <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous.</strong></p>



      <ol type="a">

        <li>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform

        the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the

        recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and

        conditions as the license granted to You under this

        License.</li>



        <li>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform

        unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the

        validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of

        this License, and without further action by the parties to

        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and

        enforceable.</li>



        <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed

        waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or

        consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be

        charged with such waiver or consent.</li>

        waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or

        consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be

        the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. To the

        full extent permitted by applicable law, there are no

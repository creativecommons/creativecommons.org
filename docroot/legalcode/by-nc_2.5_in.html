      in consideration of You exercising the rights, a worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of

      the Work as stated below:</p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one
        or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
        incorporated in the Collective Works;</li>

        <li>to create and reproduce Adaptations of the Work;</li>

        <li>to distribute copies or, display or perform publicly
        <u>including by means of a digital audio transmission</u>,
        the Work, including as incorporated in Collective
        Works;</li>

        <li>to distribute copies of, display, communicate to the
        public or perform publicly, including by means of a digital
        audio transmission the Adaptations of the Work;</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">The above rights may be
        exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
        hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
        make such modifications as are technically necessary to
        exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights
        not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
        including but not limited to the rights set forth in
        Section 4, below.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in
      Section 3, above, is expressly made subject to and limited by
      the following restrictions:</p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>You may reproduce, distribute, publicly display,
        publicly perform, communicate the Work, publicly digitally
        perform the Work or create an adaptation of the Work only
        under the terms of this License and You must include a copy
        of this License, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for
        this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
        distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
        digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
        the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License
        or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
        hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
        intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
        disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
        display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
        the Work with any technological measures that control
        access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
        terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the
        Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
        not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
        to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
        create a Collective Work, upon notice from the Licensor,
        You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
        Collective Work any credit as required by Clause 4(c), as
        requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
        the Licensor, You must, to the extent practicable, remove
        from the Adaptation any credit as required by Clause 4(c) as
        requested.</li>

        <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
        in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended
        for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
        monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
        copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
        otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or
        directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
        compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
        compensation in connection with such an exchange of
        copyrighted works.</li>

        <li>If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
        or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Adaptation or
        Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
        notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
        or means You are utilizing, the following:

          <ol type="1">
            <li>the name of the Author (or pseudonym, if
            applicable) if supplied, and/or;</li>

            <li>if the Author and/or Licensor designates another
            party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing
            entity or journal) for attribution in the Licensor's
            copyright notice, terms of service or by other
            reasonable means, the name of such party or
            parties;</li>

            <li>the title of the Work if supplied;</li>

            <li>to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
            Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to
            be associated with the Work, unless such Uniform
            Resource Identifier does not refer to the copyright
            notice or licensing information for the Work;and</li>

            <li>in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying
            the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "Hindi
            translation of the Work by Author," or "Screenplay
            based on original Work by Author"). Such credit may be
            implemented in any reasonable manner. It is provided,
            however, that in the case of an Adaptation or
            Collective Work, at a minimum, such credit must appear
            where any other comparable authorship credit appears
            and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
            comparable authorship credit.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and
      Disclaimer.</strong></p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN

        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
        ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
        PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</li>

        <li>YOU WARRANT THAT YOU ARE THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OF THE
        CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN YOU SUBMIT THEM TO CREATIVE
        COMMONS.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong></p>

      <p>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO
      EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
      FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
      EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF
      THE WORK, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Termination.</strong></p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
        terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms
        of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
        Adaptations or Collective Works from You under this License
        however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
        such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
        their licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive
        any termination of this License.</li>

        granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
        applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
        above, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
        under different license terms or to stop distributing the
        Work at any time; provided, however that any such release
        under different license terms or cessation of distribution
        of the Work will not serve to withdraw this License (or any
        other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
        under the terms of this License), and this License will
        continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
        stated above.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous.</strong></p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform
        the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the
        recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
        conditions as the license granted to You under this

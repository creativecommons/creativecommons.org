        CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
                SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT

PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON                 AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE
COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE                 INFORMATION

        <p><em>License</em> </p>

<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. </p>

<p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
AND CONDITIONS.  </p>


<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong> </p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical
issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.
A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work or
upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which
the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
for the purpose of this License. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers
the Work under the
terms of this License. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the individual or entity who
created the Work.
</p></li>

<li>
<p><strong>"Work"</strong>  means the copyrightable work of authorship
offered under the terms
of this License.
</p></li>

<li>
<p><strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising rights
under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is
intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
copyright law or other applicable laws. </p>


<p><strong>3. License Grant & Restrictions.</strong>  Subject to the
terms and conditions of
this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below on the
conditions as stated below:  </p>


<ol type="a">

<li>
<strong>Noncommercial use only.</strong> You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in this license in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

<li>
<strong>Noncommercial re-creativity permitted</strong>. You may create and reproduce
Derivative Works, provided that:
</li>

<ol type="i">
    <li><p>
    the Derivative Work(s) constitute a
good-faith partial or recombined
      usage employing "sampling," "collage," "mash-up," or other
comparable   artistic         technique, whether now known or hereafter
devised, that is     highly transformative of the original, as
appropriate to the medium, genre,     and market niche;  and</p></li>

<li><p>Your Derivative Work(s) must only make a partial use of the
original
Work, or if You choose to use the original Work as a whole, You must
either use the Work as an insubstantial portion of Your Derivative
Work(s) or transform it into something substantially different from the
original Work. In the case of a musical Work and/or audio recording, the
mere
synchronization ("synching") of the Work with a moving image shall not be
considered a transformation of the Work into something substantially
different.</p></li>
</ol>

<li><p>You may distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
publicly, perform  publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
audio transmission, any Derivative Work(s) authorized under this
License. </p> </li>

<li>
<p><strong>Noncommercial sharing of verbatim copies
permitted</strong>.</p></li>

<ol type="i">
    <li><p>
You may reproduce the Work, incorporate the Work into one or more
Collective Works, and reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
Collective Works. You may distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
audio transmission the Work including or incorporated in Collective
Works.</p></li>
</ol>

<li>
<p><strong>Attribution and Notice</strong>.</p></li>

<ol type="i">
    <li><p>
If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the
Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are
utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the
Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
extent reasonably practicable, provide the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
specifies
to be associated with the Work or a Derivative Work, unless such Uniform Resource Identifier does
not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
and in the
case of a Derivative Work, provide a credit identifying the use of the
Work in
the Derivative Work (e.g., "Remix of the Work by Original Author," or
"Inclusion of a portion of the Work by Original Author in collage").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a
minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
comparable authorship credit.</p></li>

<li><p>You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform or publicly
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work or Derivative Work You
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or
restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties.  You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures
that control access of use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
terms of this License. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. Upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
the Derivative Work or Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested. </p>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
other media and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
are hereby reserved. </p>


<p><strong>4. Disclaimer</strong></p>

<P>UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE BY THE PARTIES IN A SEPARATE WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.</p>


<p><strong>5. Limitation on Liability.</strong></p>

<p>IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON
ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>


<p><strong>6. Termination</strong> </p>

<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective
Works from You under
this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
licenses. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will survive any termination of
this License. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been granted under
the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
and effect unless terminated as stated above. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>7. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>

<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
Collective Work, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
License. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements, or representations with respect to the Work, and with respect
to the subject matter hereof, not specified above. Licensor shall not be
bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You. </p>
</li>

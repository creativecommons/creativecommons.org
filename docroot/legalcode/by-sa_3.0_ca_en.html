            THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS

            CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" or "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS

            PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE

            WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE IS PROHIBITED.

          </p>

          <p>

            BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND

            AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. TO THE EXTENT THIS

            LICENCE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU

            THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF

            SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

          </p>

          <p>

            <strong>1. Definitions</strong>

          </p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>

              <strong>"Adaptation"</strong> means a work based upon the Work,

              or upon the Work and other preexisting works. Adaptations

              include:

              <ol type="i">

                <li>Translations of the Work;

                </li>

                <li>Where the Work is a dramatic work: conversions of the Work

                into a novel or other non-dramatic work;

                </li>

                <li>Where the Work is a novel or other non-dramatic work or an

                artistic work: conversions of the Work into a dramatic work by

                way of performance in public or otherwise;

                </li>

                <li>Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical work: a

                sound recording, cinematograph film or other mechanical

                contrivance by means of which the Work may be mechanically

                reproduced or performed; and

                </li>

                <li>Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical or

                artistic work: reproductions, adaptations or public

                presentations of the Work as a cinematographic work.

                </li>

              </ol>A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence. Where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in time-relation with a moving image (i.e. cinematographic work “synching”) will be treated as an Adaptation for the purposes of this Licence.

            </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"Author"</strong> has the same meaning determined by

              applicable law. For example, the Author is (i) the individuals or

              entities who created a literary or artistic work or, if no

              individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; (ii) the

              individuals who perform a performance; (iii) the producer who

              first fixes the sounds of a performance in an audio recording;

              or, (iv) the organization that transmits a broadcast.

             </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means (i) an encyclopaedia,

              dictionary, year book or similar work; (ii) a newspaper, review,

              magazine or similar periodical; and (iii) any work written in

              distinct parts by different authors, or in which works or parts

              of works of different authors are incorporated. A work that

              constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered an

              Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this Licence.

            </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"Creative Commons Compatible Licence"</strong> means a

              licence that is listed at

              https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been

              approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to

              this Licence including, at a minimum, because that licence: (i)

              contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as

              the Licence Elements of this Licence; and (ii) explicitly permits

              the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that

              licence under this Licence or a Creative Commons jurisdiction

              licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence.

            </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"Licence Elements"</strong> means the following high-

              level Licence attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in

              the title of this Licence: Attribution, ShareAlike.

            </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual, individuals,

              entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this

              Licence.

            </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"Musical Work"</strong> means any work of music or

              musical composition, with or without words, and includes any

              compilation thereof.

            </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"Work"</strong> means the work of authorship offered

              under the terms of this Licence.

            </li>

            <li>

              <strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising

              rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the

              terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has

              received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights

              under this Licence despite a previous violation.

            </li>

          </ol>

          <p>

            <strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights:</strong> Nothing in this Licence is

            intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights accruing to fair

            dealing and those exemptions afforded to individuals, educational

            institutions, libraries, archives, museums, computer programs,

            incidental inclusions and ephemeral recordings, or other

            limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under

            the Copyright Act.

          </p>

          <p>

            <strong>3. Licence Grant:</strong> Subject to the terms and

            conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,

            royalty- free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the

            applicable copyright) Licence to exercise the rights in the Work as

            stated below:

          </p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more

            Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the

            Collective Works;

            </li>

            <li>to create and reproduce Adaptations provided that any such

            Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes

            reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify

            that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a

            translation could be marked, "The original work was translated from

            English to Spanish", or a modification could indicate, "The

            original work has been modified";

            </li>

            <li>to distribute and publicly perform the Work including as

            incorporated in Collective Works; and,

            </li>

            <li>to distribute and publicly perform Adaptations; and,

            </li>

            <li>

              <p>

                For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical

                composition, performer's performance or sound recording:

              </p>

              <ol type="i">

                <li>

                  <strong>Performance Royalties Under Blanket

                  Licences:</strong> Licensor reserves the exclusive right to

                  collect, whether individually or via a performance rights

                  society, royalties for the public performance or public

                  digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the musical Work, sound

                  recording or performer's performance where applicable under

                  Canadian law.

                </li>

                <li>

                  <strong>Mechanical Rights in Musical Works:</strong> Licensor

                  reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually

                  create from the musical Work ("cover version") where

                  applicable under Canadian law.

          <p>

            The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether

            now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right

            to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise

            the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly

            granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

          </p>

          <p>

            <strong>4. Restrictions:</strong> The licence granted in Section 3

            above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following

            restrictions:

          </p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>You may distribute or publicly perform the Work only under the

            terms of this Licence. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform

            Resource Identifier (URI) for, this Licence with every copy of the

            Work You distribute or publicly perform. You may not offer or

            impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this

            Licence or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the

            rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Licence.

            You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices

            that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with

            every copy of the Work You distribute or publicly perform. When You

            distribute or publicly perform the Work, You may not impose any

            technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a

            recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to

            that recipient under the terms of the Licence. This Section 4(a)

            applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this

            does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to

            be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a

            Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the

            extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as

            required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an

            Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent

            practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by

            Section 4(c), as requested.

            </li>

            <li>You may distribute or publicly perform an Adaptation only

            under: (i) the terms of this Licence; (ii) a later version of this

            Licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence; (iii)

            either the Creative Commons (Unported) licence or a Creative

            Commons jurisdiction licence (either this or a later version) that

            contains the same Licence Elements as this Licence (e.g.,

            Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)) ("Applicable

            Licence"); or (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible Licence. If you

            license the Adaptation under one of the licences mentioned in (iv),

            you must comply with the terms of that licence. If you license the

            Adaptation under the terms any of the licences mentioned in (i),

            (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable Licence"), you must comply with the

            terms of the Applicable Licence generally and the following

            provisions: You must include a copy of or the URI for the

            Applicable Licence or other licence specified in the previous

            sentence with every copy of or sound recording of each Adaptation

            You distribute or publicly perform. You may not offer or impose any

            terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable

            Licence or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to

            exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of

            the Applicable Licence. You must keep intact all notices that refer

            to the Applicable Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with

            every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You distribute

            or publicly perform. When You distribute or publicly perform the

            Adaptation, You may not impose any technological measures on the

            Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the

            Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that

            recipient under the terms of the Applicable Licence. This Section

            4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collective

            Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the

            Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable

            Licence.

            </li>

            <li>If You distribute, or publicly perform the Work or any

            Adaptations or Collective Works, You must, unless a request has

            been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright

            notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means

            You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Author (or pseudonym, if

            applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Author and/or Licensor

            designates another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,

            publishing entity, journal) for attribution (“Attribution Parties”)

            in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other

            reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title

            of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably

            practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be

            associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the

            copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)

            consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a

            credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,

            “French translation of the Work by Author,” or “Screenplay based on

            original Work by Author”). The credit required by this Section 4(c)

            may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,

            that in the case of an Adaptation or Collective Work, at a minimum

            such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors

            of the Adaptation or Collective Work appears, then as part of these

            credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for

            the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may

            only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of

            attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your

            rights under this Licence, You may not implicitly or explicitly

            assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by

            the Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of

            You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior

            written permission of the Author, Licensor and/or Attribution

            Parties.

            </li>

            <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Author, in those

            jurisdictions in which the moral right of integrity exists and by

            operation of local law constrains the freedom to adapt or collect

            the licensed Work, where Licensor holds moral rights in the Work

            and where the exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this

            Licence (the right to make Adaptations) could violate the moral

            right of integrity, Licensor agrees to waive or not assert, as

            appropriate, the moral right of integrity, to the fullest extent

            permitted by the applicable national law, as long as You do not

            distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in

            relation to the Work that would be prejudicial to the Author’s

            honour or reputation, so as to enable You to reasonably exercise

            Your right under Section 3(b) of this Licence but not otherwise.

            </li>

          </ol>

          <p>

            <strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong>

          </p>

          <p>

            UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,

            LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR

            WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,

            STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES

            OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,

            NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,

            ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT

            DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF

            IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

          </p>

          <p>

            <strong>6. Limitation on Liability</strong>

          </p>

          <p>

            EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR

            DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM

            BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE

            LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,

            CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS

            LICENCE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED

            OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

          <p>

            <strong>7. Termination</strong>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

            automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence.

            Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collective

            Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their

            licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in

            full compliance with those licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8

            will survive any termination of this Licence.

            </li>

            <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted

            here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in

            the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right

            to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop

            distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such

            election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other

            licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the

            terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full

            force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

            </li>

          </ol>

          <p>

            <strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong>

          </p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>Each time You distribute or publicly perform the Work or a

            Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to

            the Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to

            You under this Licence.

            </li>

            <li>Each time You distribute or publicly perform an Adaptation,

            Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the original Work on

            the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You under

            this Licence.

            </li>

            <li>If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable

            under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or

            enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and

            without further action by the parties to this agreement, such

            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make

            such provision valid and enforceable.

            </li>

            <li>No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and

            no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in

            writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or

            consent.

            </li>

            <li>This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the

            parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no

            understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the

            Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any

            additional provisions that may appear in any communication from

            You. This Licence may not be modified without the mutual written

            agreement of the Licensor and You.

            </li>

            <li>You must abide the Licence during its term despite the expiry,

            initial invalidity or later invalidation of any intellectual

            property rights.

            </li>

            <li>The construction, validity and performance of this Licence

            shall be governed by the laws in force in Canada and, where

            applicable, those of the province in which the Licensor normally

            resides.

          <p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE

          TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE

          ("LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR

          OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS

          AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS

          PROHIBITED.</p>

          <p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE,

          YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS

          LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED

          HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS

          AND CONDITIONS.</p>

          <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li><strong>"Collection"</strong> means the Work in its

            entirety in unmodified form along with one or more

            other separate and independent works, assembled into a

            collective whole. A Collection may, for example,

            include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A

            Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for

            the purposes of this Licence.</li>

            <li><strong>"Commercial"</strong> means primarily

            intended for or directed towards commercial advantage

            or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the

            Work for other copyright works by means of digital

            file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be

            Commercial, provided there is no payment of any

            monetary compensation in connection with the exchange

            of copyright works.</li>

            <li><strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means material

            in any form that is created by editing, modifying or

            adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or

            the Work and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works

            may, for example, include a translation, adaptation,

            musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture

            version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,

            condensation, or any other form in which the Work may

            be transformed or adapted, except that a Collection

            will not be considered a Derivative Work for the

            purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt,

            where the Work is a musical composition or sound

            recording, the synchronization of the Work in

            timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be

            considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this

            Licence.</li>

            <li><strong>"Distribute"</strong> means to make

            available to the public by any means, including

            publication, electronic communication, or

            broadcast.</li>

            <li><strong>"Licence Elements"</strong> means the

            following high-level licence attributes indicated in

            the title of this Licence: Attribution, NonCommercial,

            ShareAlike.</li>

            <li><strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual,

            individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work

            under the terms of this Licence.</li>

            <li><strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the

            individual, individuals, entity or entities who created

            the Work.</li>

            <li><strong>"Reproduce"</strong> means to make a copy

            of the Work in any material form (eg storage in digital

            form).</li>

            <li><strong>"Work"</strong> means the material

            (including any work or other subject matter) protected

            by copyright which is offered under the terms of this

            Licence. This may include (without limitation) a

            literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; a sound

            recording or cinematograph film; a published edition of

            a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a

            television or sound broadcast.</li>

            <li><strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or

            entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not

            previously violated the terms of this Licence with

            respect to the Work, or who has received express

            permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under

            this Licence despite a previous violation.</li>

          </ol>

          <p><strong>2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights</strong></p>

          <p>Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit,

          or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights

          arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright

          law or any other applicable laws.</p>

          <p><strong>3. Licence Grant</strong></p>

          <p><strong><em>3A Grant of Rights</em></strong></p>

          <p>Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are

          satisfied, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide,

          royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration

          of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the

          following rights:</p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>Reproduce the Work;</li>

            <li>incorporate the Work into one or more

            Collections;</li>

            <li>Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any

            Collection;</li>

            <li>create and Reproduce one or more Derivative Works;

            and</li>

            <li>Distribute and publicly perform the Work, a

            Derivative Work or the Work as incorporated in any

            Collection.</li>

          </ol>

          <p><strong><em>3B Media and Formats</em></strong></p>

          <p>The above rights may be exercised in any media or

          format whether now known or hereafter created. They

          include the right to make modifications that are

          technically necessary to exercise the rights in other

          media and formats.</p>

          <p><strong><em>3C Other Rights Reserved</em></strong></p>

          <p>All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are

          reserved. This includes the right to collect royalties,

          whether individually or via a licensing body such as a

          collecting society, for any Commercial use of the Work.

          The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for

          any exercise by You of the rights granted under this

          Licence.</p>

          <p><strong>4. Restrictions</strong></p>

          <p>The licence granted above is limited by the following

          restrictions.</p>

          <p><strong><em>4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public

          Performance of the Work</em></strong></p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work

            only under the terms of this Licence.</li>

            <li>You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource

            Identifier (such as a web link) for, this Licence with

            every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly

            perform.</li>

            <li>You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work

            that restrict this Licence or the ability of a

            recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights

            granted to them by this Licence.</li>

            <li>You are not granted the right to sublicense the

            Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are

            governed by clause 9.</li>

            <li>You must keep intact all notices that refer to this

            Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every

            copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly

            perform.</li>

            <li>When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work,

            You must not impose any technological measures on it

            that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work

            from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this

            Licence.</li>

            <li>For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A

            applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection,

            it does not require other material within the

            Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work

            itself, to be made subject to this Licence.</li>

          </ol>

          <p><strong><em>4B Restrictions on Distribution and Public

          Performance of Derivative Works</em></strong></p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>

              You may only Distribute or publicly perform a

              Derivative Work if you apply one of the following

              licences to it:

              <ol type="i">

                <li>this Licence;</li>

                <li>a later version of this Licence with the same

                Licence Elements (such as

                Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0

                Australia); or</li>

                <li>a Creative Commons Unported licence or a

                licence from another jurisdiction (either this or a

                later version) that has the same Licence Elements

                (such as Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0

                Netherlands).</li>

              </ol>

              In this clause 4B, whichever of the above licences

              You choose to apply to a Derivative Work is the

              "Applicable Licence".

            </li>

            <li>You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource

            Identifier (such as a web link) for, the Applicable

            Licence with every copy of the Derivative Work You

            Distribute or publicly perform.</li>

            <li>You must not impose any terms on the Derivative

            Work that restrict the Applicable Licence, or the

            ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You

            to exercise the rights granted to them by that

            licence.</li>

            <li>You must keep intact all notices that refer to this

            Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties

            with every copy of the Work as included in the

            Derivative Work that You Distribute or publicly

            perform.</li>

            <li>When You Distribute or publicly perform a

            Derivative Work You must not impose any technological

            measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient

            of the Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights

            granted to them by the Applicable Licence.</li>

            <li>For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4B

            applies to any Derivative Work as incorporated into a

            Collection, it does not require other material within

            the Collection, or the Collection as a whole, to be

            made subject to the terms of the Applicable

            Licence.</li>

          </ol>

          <p><strong><em>4C Restrictions on Commercial

          Use</em></strong></p>

          <p>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You

          by clause 3 above in any Commercial manner.</p>

          <p><strong><em>4D Attribution and Notice

          Requirements</em></strong></p>

          <ol type="a">

            <li>When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or

            any Derivative Work or Collection You must keep intact

            all copyright notices for the Work.</li>

            <li>

              When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or

              any Derivative Work or Collection You must provide,

              in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are

              using:

              <ol type="i">

                <li>the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the

                Original Author and/or of any other party (such as

                a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal)

                that the Original Author or Licensor has requested

                be attributed (such as in the copyright notice or

                terms of use). In this clause 4D these parties are

                referred to as "Attribution Parties";</li>

                <li>the title of the Work (if provided); and</li>

                <li>to the extent reasonably practicable, any

                Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link)

                that the Licensor specifies should be associated

                with the Work that refers to the copyright notice

                or licensing information for the Work.</li>

              </ol>

            </li>

            <li>For any Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly

            perform, You must take reasonable steps to clearly

            identify that changes were made to the Work. For

            example, a translation could be marked "The original

            work was translated from English to Spanish".</li>

            <li>In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the

            above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part

            of any credits for other contributing authors and be as

            prominent as the credits for those other authors.</li>

            <li>You must, to the extent practicable, remove the

            above attribution from any Collection or Derivative

            Work if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original

            Author.</li>

            <li>

              For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the

              credit required by this clause 4D for the purpose of

              attribution in the manner set out above. By

              exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must

              not assert or imply:

              <ol type="i">

                <li>any connection between the Original Author,

                Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or

                Your use of the Work; or</li>

                <li>sponsorship or endorsement by the Original

                Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of

                You or Your use of the Work,</li>

              </ol>

              without their separate, express prior written

              permission.

            </li>

          </ol>

          <p><strong><em>4E Moral Rights</em></strong></p>

          <p>Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are

          recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4E,

          "moral rights" means the personal rights granted by law

          to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example,

          Part IX of the <em>Copyright Act 1968</em> (Cth) grants

          authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right

          of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have

          authorship falsely attributed.</p>

          <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and

          Disclaimer</strong></p>

              If applicable legislation implies warranties or

              conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on

              the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot

              be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified,

              the Licensor&rsquo;s liability is limited, to the

              full extent permitted by the applicable legislation,

              at its option, to:

              <ol type="i">

                <li>

                  in the case of goods, any one or more of the

                  following:

                  <ul>

                    <li>the replacement of the goods or the supply

                    of equivalent goods;</li>

                    <li>the repair of the goods;</li>

                    <li>the payment of the cost of replacing the

                    goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;</li>

                    <li>the payment of the cost of having the goods

                    repaired; or</li>

                  </ul>

                </li>

                <li>

                  in the case of services:

                    <li>the supplying of the services again;

                    or</li>

                    <li>the payment of the cost of having the

                    services supplied again.</li>

                  </ul>

                </li>

              </ol>

            </li>

            <li>The <em>Trade Practices Act 1974</em> (Cth), and

            the corresponding State and Territory fair trading

            legislation, restrict the limitation of liability in

            certain circumstances, such as a contract for the

            supply of goods or services of a kind ordinarily

            acquired for personal, domestic, or household use.

            Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to

            apply in circumstances where it is prohibited by

            law.</li>

          </ol>

          <p><strong>7. Termination</strong></p>

          <p>This Licence and the rights granted to You under this

          Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by

          You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities

          who have received a Derivative Work or a Collection from

          You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have

          their licences terminated provided they remain in full

          compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8,

          9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of

          this Licence.</p>

          <p><strong>8. Licensor&rsquo;s Rights

          Retained</strong></p>

          <p>Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here

          is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable

          copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the

          Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under

          different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work

          at any time. However, any such release will not serve to

          withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been

          granted under the terms of this Licence), and this

          Licence will continue in full force and effect unless

          terminated as stated above.</p>

          <p><strong>9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work

          from You</strong></p>

          <p>Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work,

          a Derivative Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the

          recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are

          granted to You under this Licence.</p>

          <p><strong>10. Severability</strong></p>

          <p>If any provision of this Licence is invalid or

          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect

          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the

          terms of this Licence. Without further action by the

          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be

          reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such

          provision valid and enforceable.</p>

          <p><strong>11. Waivers and Consents</strong></p>

          <p>No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no

          breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in

          writing and signed by the relevant party.</p>

          <p><strong>12. Entire Agreement</strong></p>

          <p>This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between

          the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there

          are no understandings, agreements or representations with

          respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor

          shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may

          appear in any communication from You. This Licence may

          not be modified without the written agreement of the

          Licensor and You.</p>

          <p><strong>13. Governing Law</strong></p>

          <p>The construction, validity and performance of this

          Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in the

          Australian Capital Territory, Australia.</p>

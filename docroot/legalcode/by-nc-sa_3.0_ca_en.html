          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>"Adaptation"</strong> means a work based upon the Work,
              or upon the Work and other preexisting works. Adaptations
              include:
              <ol type="i">
                <li>Translations of the Work;
                </li>
                <li>Where the Work is a dramatic work: conversions of the Work
                into a novel or other non-dramatic work;
                </li>
                <li>Where the Work is a novel or other non-dramatic work or an
                artistic work: conversions of the Work into a dramatic work by
                way of performance in public or otherwise;
                </li>
                <li>Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical work: a
                sound recording, cinematograph film or other mechanical
                contrivance by means of which the Work may be mechanically
                reproduced or performed; and
                </li>
                <li>Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical or
                artistic work: reproductions, adaptations or public
                presentations of the Work as a cinematographic work.
                </li>
              </ol>A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
              considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence. Where
              the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
              synchronization of the Work in time-relation with a moving image
              (i.e. cinematographic work “synching”) will be treated as an
              Adaptation for the purposes of this Licence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Author"</strong> has the same meaning determined by
              applicable law. For example, the Author is (i) the individuals or
              entities who created a literary or artistic work or, if no
              individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; (ii) the
              individuals who perform a performance; (iii) the producer who
              first fixes the sounds of a performance in an audio recording;
              or, (iv) the organization that transmits a broadcast.
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means (i) an encyclopaedia,
              dictionary, year book or similar work; (ii) a newspaper, review,
              magazine or similar periodical; and (iii) any work written in
              distinct parts by different authors, or in which works or parts
              of works of different authors are incorporated. A work that
              constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered an
              Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this Licence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Licence Elements"</strong> means the following high-
              level Licence attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in
              the title of this Licence: Attribution, NonCommercial,
              ShareAlike.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual, individuals,
              entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this
              Licence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Musical Work"</strong> means any work of music or
              musical composition, with or without words, and includes any
              compilation thereof.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Work"</strong> means the work of authorship offered
              under the terms of this Licence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising
              rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the
              terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has
              received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
              under this Licence despite a previous violation.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights:</strong> Nothing in this Licence is
            intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights accruing to fair
            dealing and those exemptions afforded to individuals, educational
            institutions, libraries, archives, museums, computer programs,
            incidental inclusions and ephemeral recordings, or other
            limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
            the Copyright Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Licence Grant:</strong> Subject to the terms and
            conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
            royalty- free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
            applicable copyright) Licence to exercise the rights in the Work as
            stated below:
          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
            Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
            Collective Works;
            </li>
            <li>to create and reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
            Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
            reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
            that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
            translation could be marked, "The original work was translated from
            English to Spanish", or a modification could indicate, "The
            original work has been modified";
            </li>
            <li>to distribute and publicly perform the Work including as
            incorporated in Collective Works; and,
            </li>
            <li>to distribute and publicly perform Adaptations.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
            now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
            to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
            the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly
            granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited
            to the rights set forth in Section 4(c) and 4(e).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4. Restrictions:</strong> The licence granted in Section 3
            above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
            restrictions:
          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>You may distribute or publicly perform the Work only under the
            terms of this Licence. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
            Resource Identifier (URI) for, this Licence with every copy of the
            Work You distribute or publicly perform. You may not offer or
            impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
            Licence or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
            rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Licence.
            You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
            that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with
            every copy of the Work You distribute or publicly perform. When You
            distribute or publicly perform the Work, You may not impose any
            technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
            recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
            that recipient under the terms of the Licence. This Section 4(a)
            applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
            does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to
            be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a
            Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
            extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as
            required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an
            Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
            practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
            Section 4(d), as requested.
            </li>
            <li>You may distribute or publicly perform an Adaptation only
            under: (i) the terms of this Licence; (ii) a later version of this
            Licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence; or (iii)
            either the Creative Commons (Unported) licence or a Creative
            Commons jurisdiction licence (either this or a later version) that
            contains the same Licence Elements as this Licence (e.g.,
            Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)) ("Applicable
            Licence"). You must include a copy of or the URI for the Applicable
            Licence or other licence specified in the previous sentence with
            every copy of or sound recording of each Adaptation You distribute
            or publicly perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
            Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable Licence or the
            ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
            granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
            Licence. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
            Applicable Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
            copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You distribute or
            publicly perform. When You distribute or publicly perform the
            Adaptation, You may not impose any technological measures on the
            Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
            Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
            recipient under the terms of the Applicable Licence. This Section
            4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collective
            Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
            Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
            Licence.
            </li>
            <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in
            Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or
            directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
            compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works
            by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be
            considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
            advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
            payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the
            exchange of copyrighted works.
            </li>
            <li>If You distribute, or publicly perform the Work or any
            Adaptations or Collective Works, You must, unless a request has
            been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
            notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
            You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Author (or pseudonym, if
            applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Author and/or Licensor
            designates another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
            publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties")
            in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
            reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
            of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
            practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
            associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
            copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
            consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
            credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
            "French translation of the Work by Author," or "Screenplay based on
            original Work by Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(d)
            may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
            that in the case of an Adaptation or Collective Work, at a minimum
            such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
            of the Adaptation or Collective Work appears, then as part of these
            credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
            the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
            only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
            attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
            rights under this Licence, You may not implicitly or explicitly
            assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by
            the Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
            You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
            written permission of the Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
            Parties.

                  digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the musical Work, sound

            operation of local law constrains the freedom to adapt or collect
            the licensed Work, where Licensor holds moral rights in the Work
            and where the exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
            Licence (the right to make Adaptations) could violate the moral
            right of integrity, Licensor agrees to waive or not assert, as
            appropriate, the moral right of integrity, to the fullest extent
            permitted by the applicable national law, as long as You do not
            distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
            relation to the Work that would be prejudicial to the Author’s
            honour or reputation, so as to enable You to reasonably exercise
            Your right under Section 3(b) of this Licence but not otherwise.

            Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their
            licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
            full compliance with those licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
            will survive any termination of this Licence.
            </li>
            <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted
            here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
            the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
            to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop
            distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
            election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other
            licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
            terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full
            force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

          <ol type="a">
            <li>Each time You distribute or publicly perform the Work or a
            Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to
            the Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to
            You under this Licence.
            </li>
            <li>Each time You distribute or publicly perform an Adaptation,
            Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the original Work on
            the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You under
            this Licence.
            </li>
            <li>If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable
            under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
            enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and
            without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
            such provision valid and enforceable.
            </li>
            <li>No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and
            no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
            writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
            consent.
            </li>
            <li>This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the
            parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
            understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
            Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
            additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
            You. This Licence may not be modified without the mutual written
            agreement of the Licensor and You.
            </li>
            <li>You must abide the Licence during its term despite the expiry,
            initial invalidity or later invalidation of any intellectual
            property rights.
            </li>
            <li>The construction, validity and performance of this Licence
            shall be governed by the laws in force in Canada and, where
            applicable, those of the province in which the Licensor normally
            resides.
